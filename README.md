# Hi, I'm Ashwini Nagathan 

🎓 I'm an Engineering Management grad student at Northeastern University, blending tech, business, and creativity. With a background in Computer Science, my journey began with an analytics internship at Zwayam, where I explored data-driven decision-making. It continued at Pearson, developing user-friendly software solutions. Currently, as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Northeastern, I mentor students through economic analyses and strategic frameworks. 

I'm passionate about turning complex data into meaningful products and stories, focusing on digital product design, data visualization, and agile methodologies.

🧁 When I'm not diving into data or product strategies, I enjoy baking and experimenting with new recipes!
