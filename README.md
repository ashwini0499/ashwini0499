# Hi, I'm Ashwini Nagathan 

I'm an Engineering Management grad student at Northeastern University, blending tech, business, and creativity. With a background in Computer Science, my journey began with an analytics internship at Zwayam, where I explored data-driven decision-making, and continued at Tata Consultancy Services, developing user-friendly software solutions. Currently, as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Northeastern, I mentor students through economic analyses and strategic frameworks. 

I'm passionate about turning complex data into meaningful products and stories, focusing on digital product design, data visualization, and agile methodologies.

When I'm not diving into data or product strategies, I enjoy baking and trying out new recipes!
